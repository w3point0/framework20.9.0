# Appendix

Node.js version 20.9.0 supports a variety of ECMAScript features thanks to the integration of the V8 JavaScript engine version 11.3. Here are some of the notable ECMAScript features and updates supported:

1. **String Methods**:
   - `String.prototype.isWellFormed` and `String.prototype.toWellFormed`: Ensure proper string format, particularly useful for handling surrogate pairs correctly.

2. **Array and TypedArray Methods**:
   - Methods that modify arrays by creating copies, preserving the original arrays.

3. **Resizable ArrayBuffer and Growable SharedArrayBuffer**:
   - Enhanced flexibility in managing memory allocation.

4. **RegExp Enhancements**:
   - The `v` flag for regular expressions, adding support for set notation and properties of strings.

5. **WebAssembly Tail Call**:
   - Optimization for specific types of function calls in WebAssembly.

6. **Stable Features**:
   - The `import.meta.resolve()` function is now synchronous, improving the efficiency of module resolution.

Additionally, Node.js 20.9.0 introduces several other improvements and experimental features:

- **Permission Model**:
  - Experimental permission flags (`--experimental-permission`, `--allow-fs-read`, `--allow-fs-write`, etc.) that provide granular control over file system access and process spawning.

- **Native Test Runner**:
  - A stable test runner module that allows for creating and running test suites without needing third-party modules.

- **Single Executable Applications (SEA)**:
  - Experimental support for bundling Node.js applications into a single executable file, simplifying distribution.

These updates and features ensure that Node.js 20.9.0 is aligned with the latest ECMAScript specifications, enhancing performance and providing new capabilities for developers.
